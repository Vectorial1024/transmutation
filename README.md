(This is a WIP project!)

The "Collections" library for PHP array-like objects. (What are "array-like objects"? See `vectorial1024/alof_lib` [here](https://github.com/Vectorial1024/alof-lib).)

See the change log in the CHANGELOG.md file.

## Installation
via Composer:

```sh
composer require vectorial1024/transmutation
```

## Testing
Using PHPUnit via Composer::

```sh
composer run-script test
```

## Relationship with `alof_lib`
`alof_lib` does the dirty work and ensures the correctness of ALO functions, while this library provides an easy-to-use API for ALO processing.
